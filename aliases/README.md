A bunch of useful aliasses for lingo devs

## Setup
Find where you stored `my_locations.config`. In this repository this is 1 folder up.

1. Add and adapt the following line to your aliases in your `.zshrc`: 
```
. /path/to/wherever/you/store/my_aliasses.config;
```

2. In `my_aliasses.config`. Adapt line 1 to 
```
. /path/to/wherever/you/store/my_locations.config;
```

3. Start a new zsh terminal. All aliases from `my_aliasses.config` should now be available.
